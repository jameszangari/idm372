# Shuffle Web App
#### Requirements: [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#
#### 1. Initialize the app

---

1. In the Command Line, navigate to the directory ( **idm372** )
2. Download the *node_modules* using: `npm install`
3. Install nodemon globally using `npm i nodemon -g`
4. Fix any npm issues by running `npm audit fix`
5. Go to Microsoft Teams and download the necessary ***secret*** files: `Back End Development/Secret_Keys_2021`

---

#
#### 2. Setup the secret keys

---

1. Download the `secret` folder from this directory
2. Copy the contents of this folder to the secret folder in the root of this project, outside of the `public` folder (create this folder if it does not exist for you)
3. Download `firebase-config.js` and copy it into `src/scripts/` (make sure this lives outside of the modules folder)

---

#
#### 3. Run the app

---

1. Run the command `nodemon server.js` to startup the express server (nodemon watches the files for changes and refreshes the server)
2. The server will then be running on `localhost:8888`
3. In a new terminal tab/window, run the command `npm run dev` to build the files for development. Webpack will compile all files and watch for changes on save
4. Go to `localhost:8888` in your preferred browser to view the build

## Working with the files
* **!!!** Before making any changes, **branch off of the main** using `git checkout -b (insert issue name here)` (make sure you pull first using `git pull origin main`)
* If you see any issues or are assigned a task for the week, create a ticket/issue for it
* **!!!** Create a **new branch** for your work titled the same as the ticket issue e.g. `git checkout -b Issue-#7` â€“ this will sync the commits with the ticket so you can reference them in a pull request to show the changes that were fixed/worked on
    * When pushed changes from the branch use `git push --set-upstream origin *branch name*`
* Make sure you **create a pull request** when finished
    * For organization of the repo, use [emojis](https://gitmoji.dev/) when writing commits messages e.g. `:lipstick: styled footer navigation`
    * Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit 
#
### Pages
* All pages live inside the `views` folder at the root and use the `.ejs` templating language
* The url, page title, and location of the `.ejs` templates are stored as values in `src/scripts/config/endpoints.json`
    * This allows us to dynamically changes these values globally so that we don't have to manually change each value on each template e.g. `endpoints.registerAlbum.url`
* In `src/scripts/routes`, there is a file called `routes.js` which renders these pages
#### Creating New Pages
1. Create a new `.ejs` template for the page you want to create e.g. `chat.ejs`
2. In `src/scripts/routes/routes.js`, create a new function for this page underneath the others (using formatting as a reference)
    1. Use `res.render` to load up an `.ejs` view file
#
### Styling Elements
* All styles use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) | `.scss`
    * View the link to learn about nesting, partials, variables, extending, etc.
* `src/styles/main.scss` is the master file for all of these files, webpack will import all of the *partials* into this this file and compile them into a `.css` file in `public/dist/css` (this will be re-compiled everytime you save)
    * Each partial is broken out based on function, use this format for creating new files

### Debugging
* If you are running into terminal errors for express or webpack, try re-running the commands for each
    * Express: `nodemon server.js`
    * Webpack: `npm run dev`

### Extras
* Helpful VSCode plugins [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight) & [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)
    * These allow you to leave notes in certain areas of the project as a TODO list so you can come back to it later
    * Todo Tree adds a sidebar icon to VSCode which shows where every TODO note you left is so you can keep track of what's left
